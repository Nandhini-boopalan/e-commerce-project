E-Commerce Website with React Router and useContext API
Overview
This repository contains the source code for an e-commerce website built using React. The project leverages React Router for navigation and the useContext API for state management. It provides a seamless shopping experience with features such as product listing, a shopping cart, and dynamic routing.

Features
Product Listing: Display a list of products with details such as name, author, price, and an option to add/remove from the cart.

Shopping Cart: Keep track of selected products in the cart, allowing users to manage their purchases.

Routing: Utilize React Router for smooth navigation between different sections of the website, ensuring a single-page application experience.

Context API: Implement the useContext API to manage global state, enabling efficient communication between components.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the project locally:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repo
npm install
Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Project Structure
The project structure follows best practices for organizing React applications:

src/components: Contains reusable components used throughout the application.
src/pages: Defines pages that correspond to different sections of the website.
src/context: Manages global state using the useContext API.
src/routes: Configures the routes using React Router.
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
